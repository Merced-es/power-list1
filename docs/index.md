# Power List

## Introduction

Power List is an app designed for the user wanting to make daily progressions toward their goals. 
Studies have shown that you become 42% more likely to 
achieve your goals just by writing them down on a regular basis. Creating a check list 
with three to five essential tasks to complete every day is what we call a "Power List". Any progress is
 a step in the right direction, and "Power List" will help organize your goals and any plans to achieve them.

The functionalities of the app include a check list and a file uploader. 
A check list is essentially what we call the "Power List". The file uploader is used for uploading 
photos of whatever it is that you are working towards. These photos will display on your list of goals.
